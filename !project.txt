---TODO---
1. Get the text stream from the powershell script
2. Read the stream from the powershell script in real time
3. Parse the stream from the powershell script into Component and Sensor
4. Make a custom streamListener that gets toggled each time the sensor stream ends and restarts

---OPTIONAL---
- Read from stderr and see if there are any errors
- Implement subhardware instead of treating it as hardware
- Make update rate changeable in powershell script (pass it as param each time it's changed)
